        <h3>Cherry Tomato and Scallop Pasta</h3>
        <p>
            Cherry Tomato and Scallop Pasta is a dish made with cherry 
            tomatoes, scallops, and pasta. The dish is typically prepared 
            by cooking the pasta in salted water until it is al dente, and 
            then tossing it with sautéed cherry tomatoes and seared scallops.

            The combination of sweet cherry tomatoes, tender scallops, and 
            savory pasta makes for a delicious and satisfying meal that is 
            perfect for any occasion.

        <h4>How to cook?</h4>
        <div class="steps">
            <h5>Step 1</h5>
          <p>
            Arrange cherry tomatoes and scallops one layer in an oven-safe 
            baking dish. Drizzle olive oil and scatter butter, chilli flakes 
            and garlic over the ingredients. Season with salt and pepper.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h5>Step 2</h5>
          <p>
            Bake casserole in pre-heated oven of 200°C (392°F) for 15 minutes.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h5>Step 3</h5>
          <p>
            While the casserole is baking, bring a pot of water to boil with 
            1 tbsp salt added. Cook spaghetti according to package instruction 
            until al dente (firm with a bite; usually shaving about 2-3 minutes 
            from package recommended cooking time). Reserve a small cup of 
            pasta water.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h5>Step 4</h5>
          <p>
            Drain hot pasta and add directly to the baked casserole dish. 
            Toss to coat evenly, adding some starchy pasta water to help 
            bind everything together if needed. Season pasta to taste with 
            salt and pepper.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h5>Step 5</h5>
          <p>
            Divide pasta to two serving plates, sprinkle over cheese and 
            parsley. Drizzle a bit of olive oil as a finishing 
            touch before serving.
